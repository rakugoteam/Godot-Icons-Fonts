# Godot Icons Fonts

***Compatible with Godot 4.1+***

Makes easy to find and use icons from popular icon-fonts in your Godot project.

## What problems it solves:

### You only needs this addon - as you don't have:
1. to go online find font
1. then find icon
1. check icon licence - and maybe you need to search for another
1. finally download it

### Better alterative to Godot's build emojis as
- to use them you need to find unicode online
- they don't work on some platforms for example Web
- they are outdated

### Singleton
**IconsFonts** is singleton for easier use of icons anywhere in your project.

## In Editor
It's adds **IconsFinder** (docked to bottom by default).
So you can find the icons easily.
It can be in dock mode at bottom or in window mode.

That can be switched in Godot's **Tools** menu.

Or using *Command Pallet* (`Ctrl+Shift+P`)

*window mode*

## Using it with RichTextLabel
You can use the icons in RichTextLabel.

![](.assets/rich-text-icons.png)

```gdscript
@tool
extends RichTextLabel

@export_multiline
var text_with_icons: String:
	set(value):
		text_with_icons = value
		bbcode_enabled = true
		text = IconsFonts.parse_text(value)

	get: return text_with_icons

func _ready():
	bbcode_enabled = true
	text = IconsFonts.parse_text(text_with_icons)
```

## Exporting
For emojis to work in exported projects,
you need add `*.json` files to include files settings:

## Know Issues

- Window mode is init with empty icons render
- Sometimes click on icon doesn't copy it to clipboard

To fix both of them just change back-and-forward to icon font you want to use

## Compatibility
This addon is replacing our previous to addons:
- [Godot Material Icons](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Godot-Material-Icons)
- [Emojis For Godot](https://github.com/rakugoteam/Emojis-For-Godot)

We had broken backward compatibility with them for those reasons:
- In feature we want to support more IconsFonts so we can use `[icon:icons-name]` in text parsing.
- We redesigned how addon works under the hood
- We had too rename nodes
